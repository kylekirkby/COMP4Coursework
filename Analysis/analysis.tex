\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Client Identification}

	\begin{flushleft}

		My client is 30 year old plasterer Dan Austin who runs his own plastering business known as DnA Plastering. Dan mainly uses his Toshiba laptop (Dual Core Intel with 6 GB Ram and running Windows 8 64 bit) to do basic tasks such as social networking and receiving/sending emails. \par

The current system is a paper based method where he records the prices and measurements of the plastering/screening/rendering jobs he undertakes. Dan works in an around the Suffolk/Essex area but occasionally takes on larger jobs further afield in places such as London or Epping. All the recording and calculations are done by Dan himself and does not require additional assistance in completing these tasks but is looking for a digital solution to the organisation problems faced with the current manual paper method. \par

Dan is looking to introduce a computer based system to replace the current one in order to make keeping track of jobs and pricing up new jobs easier and more efficient. Alongside this he would like to be able to keep information on all of his customers so he can simply search for clients' details and contact information all in one location. He will also be able to look up the jobs that he has done for them to make sending invoices easier and manageable.
